This core idea of this project was concieved as a Summer Project as part of the larger RoboISM Expo of the year 2018.

That however doesn't limit this project and over time we came to realise the full scope of this project can only be realised with a lot
of work, more than previously assumed.

Thus, to facilitate smooth transfer of ideas and seamless coding we are using Github for the Software part of the project.
